1. A line of people at an amusement park ride.

- The line is composed of members, represented as strings.
- There is a front to the line, as well as a back.
- When someone enters the line, place them at the end.
- People may leave the line whenever they see fit, and those behind them take their place.
Given the above real-world information, use an array data structure to code the following solution.

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]

let rideLine =  ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];

b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.

const addMary = rideLine.push("Mary");

c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array,
(recall that arrays are 0-based).

function findIndex(name){
 return rideLine.indexOf(name);
}
findIndex("Josh");
console.log(findIndex("Josh")); //prints 2

d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item
 in the array?

 function findIndex(name){
   if (rideLine.indexOf(name) >= 0){
     return rideLine.indexOf(name);
   } else {
     console.log("That name is not listed.");
   }
 }

 findIndex("Emily"); // outputs "That name is not listed."


e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code
this so Melissa appears before Ava?

console.log(findIndex("Ava")); //prints 1

function budgeInLine(index, name){
  return rideLine.splice(index, 0, name);
}
budgeInLine(1, "Melissa");
console.log(rideLine); //prints ["Vivian", "Melissa", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike", "Mary"]


f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?

function leaveLine(index){
  return rideLine.splice(index, 1);
}
console.log(leaveLine(4)); //prints "Patrick"
console.log(rideLine); ["Vivian", "Melissa", "Ava", "Josh", "Mike", "Mary"]


2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.


A real world example is a baseball coach submitting their team's batting lineup.
One can use an array data structure to model the players batting order.


3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

If a player gets substituted, then that player would be removed from the lineup and
a new player would take his/her spot in the batting order.

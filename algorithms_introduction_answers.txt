1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

- Making coffee;

SET Make coffee
INIT filter in basket
WHILE coffee grounds are less than 8 tablespoons
  INCREMENT 1 tablespoon of coffee grounds in filter
END WHILE
WHILE water level is less than 16oz
  INCREMENT water in water container
END While
CALL Make Coffee


- Washing dishes;


WHILE there are unclean dishes
  Rinse and scrub off stuck on food particles form item.
    IF item is dishwasher safe
      Place item in the dishwasher.
    ELSE
      Wash item by hand and place in the drying rack.
    ENDIF
ENDWHILE


- A choice of your own:   Making BBQ Chicken Wings on the grill;

SET grill to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
IF grill is less than 350 degrees
  Wait more
ELSE
  Place wings on grill
ENDIF
IF time is less than 9 minutes
  Keep wings on grill
ELSE
  Flip wings and cook for another 9 minutes
ENDIF




2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem.
It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies
who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm.
It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product).
Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about
each of your cases make them stand out?

1. Facebook: Facebook social networking algorithms have made them extremely popular.
The way people are able to connect with others and customize what they see has made
Facebook a favorite among many people.

2. Alabama NCAA Football team: the Alabama football team has consistently been one of the top
college football teams for the past 10 years.  It has won 5 national championships in that time.
Their algorithm or formula for constructing a team has been very effective.  They focus on having
the biggest, strongest and fastest players on the offensive and defensive line which helps them
control the pace of the game.  It allows their skill players on offense score more easily.  It
allows their defense to stop the other team more effectively.  This algorithm has translated into
many wins.

3. Vanguard:  Vanguard is a popular financial institution.  Their algorithm/approach to investing
has set them apart from other investment firms.  Instead of having financial advisors trying to
pick which individual stocks/bonds will give excellent returns in the market, their approach is
to invest in index funds that own large portions of the market (like the S&P 500).  These index funds
are able to match the market's return.  Their philosophy is that very few financial advisors are able
to actively beat the return of the S&P 500 over an extended period of time (10, 20, 30 years).
So instead of paying high fees to actively manage accounts, they lower their fees more than the competition,
and tend to get better returns for their clients by matching the returns of the market.



3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

An efficient algorithm is an algorithm that executes its purpose in the fastest way possible.
Algorithm efficiency is measured by the average execution time necessary for the algorithm to complete
the complete work on a set of data. An example is I can get to my neighbor's house two ways.
First, I can get to their house by walking directly from my house to their house.  Second, I can go
the other direction, walk all the way around the block, and then arrive at their house.
Both ways will get me to their house, but the first way is much more efficient. It is better to use
the most efficient algorithm because as a project grows, it becomes easier to scale when you are using
the most efficient algorithms.  If you are only dealing with 100 data points, it might not be a big
deal to have a less efficient algorithm, but if you are dealing with 1,000 or 100,000 or 1,000,000
data points the inefficiency will grow exponentially causing more problems.

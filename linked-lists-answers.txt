1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

Pros: Linked lists use less memory.  As linked lists grow larger, they do not require as much memory space as
arrays.  This is because each node is independent in memory, so the operating system may use any
available memory location to store it.  Node memory independence allows linked lists to easily grow to
immense sizes. When arrays grow larger, they require consecutive locations in memory.
Adding elements to the middle of a linked list does not require shifting many of the other elements in
the array.  If you want to insert an element in the middle of an array, half of the elements will need
to shift.

Cons: One of the biggest cons to linked lists is searching for elements.  Because there is no indexing
in a linked lists, one cannot simple search for an element's index.  Instead one has to begin one's search
in the head or first node.  Starting with the head, elements must be accessed in order.
Another con is when you insert nodes you will need to make sure you properly link a previous node to the
inserted node and have the inserted node link to the next node as to not leave any nodes orphaned.  Same
when deleting a node.  You have to make sure the node that links to the deleted node has its link
updated to reference the node that the deleted node linked to.




2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

A real world example of a linked list is a teacher decides to take 10 students on a field trip to
see a movie.  The group is unable to sit all together so it is difficult for the teacher to give
instructions to each student individually.  The teacher needs to tell Johnny his mom is there to pick him
up early for a doctor's appointment. Instead of the teacher getting up and telling Johnny
directly, the teacher tells the first student the instructions and tells that student to pass on the
information to the next student until eventually the information gets to Johnny and he can leave with
mom to get to his doctor's appointment.

Programming Questions

You may program the following questions in any language of your choice (JavaScript, Ruby, etc.).

Before beginning to code, write out a plan explaining how to solve the question.


1. The linked list push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list.
Below is pseudocode for a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong
with it. Submit both an explanation of the bug and a functional implementation of the method.

FUNCTION push(element)
CREATE node
SET node.value TO element
SET node.next TO null

IF the head node does not exist
 THEN SET head to node
ELSE
 SET current to head
 SET current.next to null // change node to null
END IF
END FUNCTION
If you're using a push function to add something to the end of a linked list.
It could only be the head node if you're adding it to an empty linked list.  Then the
`SET current.next to node` should be  `SET current.next to null`



function LinkedList(){
  var length = 0;
  var head = null;

  var Node = function(element){
    this.element = element;
    this.next = null;
  };

  this.size = function(){
    return length;
  };

  this.head = function(){
    return head.element;
  };

  this.add = function(element){
    var node = new Node(element);
    if(head === null){
      head = node;
    } else {
      var currentNode = head;
      while(currentNode.next){
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
      }
      currentNode.next = node;
    }
    length++;
  };

  this.log = function(){
    var currentNode = head;
    while (currentNode) {
       console.log(currentNode.element);
       currentNode = currentNode.next
    }
 };
}

var evenNumbers = new LinkedList();
evenNumbers.add('two');
evenNumbers.add('four');
evenNumbers.add('six');
evenNumbers.add('eight');
console.log(evenNumbers.size()); //prints 4
evenNumbers.log(); /* prints
"two"
"four"
"six"
"eight"*/



2. Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
Example
Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
Output: a -> c -> d

function LinkedList(){
  var length = 0;
  var head = null;

  var Node = function(element){
    this.element = element;
    this.next = null;
  };

  this.size = function(){
    return length;
  };

  this.head = function(){
    return head.element;
  };

  this.add = function(element){
    var node = new Node(element);
    if(head === null){
      head = node;
    } else {
      var currentNode = head;

      while(currentNode.next){
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
      }

      currentNode.next = node;
    }

    length++;
  };

   this.log = function(){
     var currentNode = head;
     while (currentNode) {
        console.log(currentNode.element);
        currentNode = currentNode.next
     }
  };

  this.removeDuplicates = function () {
    // Empty or a single element Linked List
    if (!head || !head.next) {
      console.log('No duplicates were found.');
      return;
    }
    var p1;
    var p2;
    var nodes = {};

    p1 = head;
    p2 = p1.next;
    nodes[p1.element] = true;

    while (p2) {
        var element = p2.element;
        if (nodes[element]) {
            p1.next = p2.next;
            length--
        } else {
            nodes[element] = true;
            p1 = p2;
        }
        p2 = p2.next;
    }
}
}


var letters = new LinkedList();
letters.add('a');
letters.add('c');
letters.add('d');
letters.add('d');
letters.add('a');

letters.log(); /* "a"
"c"
"d"
"d"
"a"*/

console.log(letters.size()); //prints 5
letters.removeDuplicates()

letters.log(); /* prints /* "a"
"c"
"d"*/
console.log(letters.size()); //prints 3

3. Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
Example
Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a

var Node = function(element){
   this.element = element;
   this.next = null;
 };

function LinkedList(){
 var length = 0;
 var head = null;

 this.add = function(element){
   var node = new Node(element);
   if(head === null){
     head = node;
   } else {
     var currentNode = head;

     while(currentNode.next){
       currentNode = currentNode.next;
     }

     currentNode.next = node;
   }

   length++;
 };

  this.log = function(){
    var currentNode = head;
    while (currentNode) {
       console.log(currentNode.element);
       currentNode = currentNode.next
    }
 };


 this.reverse = function() {
 let currentNode = head,
     previous = null,
     tmp;

 while (currentNode) {

   tmp = currentNode.next;


   currentNode.next = previous;


   previous = currentNode;
   currentNode = tmp;

 }
 head = previous;
}
}



var letters = new LinkedList();

letters.add('a');
letters.add('b');
letters.add('c');
letters.add('d');

letters.log(); /* prints
"a"
"b"
"c"
"d" */

letters.reverse();

letters.log() /* prints
"d"
"c"
"b"
"a"
*/
